Nanite Map/Reduce Agent Framework

Make sure you have erlang installed

Get a copy of shoes and install it:
http://shoooes.net/dist/shoes-0.r925-intel.dmg

Get amqp and get a rabbitmq server up and running in one terminal
$ sudo gem install eventmachine
$ git clone git://github.com/tmm1/amqp.git
$ cd amqp && rake install
$ cd rabbit/rabbitmq-server
$ make run


Now cd into the nanite git checkout

Let's run a script to setup 15 agent accounts with a vhost and 
permissions setup properly as well as mapper account.
(rabbitmq broker must be running before you run this script)

$ ./bin/rabbitconf


run the mapper first, takes password as single arg
$ ./bin/mapper testing

you can run as many mappers as you want, they will all be hot masters
and will be load balanced between automatically.

now run a crew of 15 agents
$ ./bin/crew

now run the gui
$ shoes lib/nanite/client.rb

Have fun!

If you would rather use a cli for the client then do this:
  
$ ./bin/agent client

>> op('list', 'merb', '/gem') {|res| p res }
