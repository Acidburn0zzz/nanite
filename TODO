TODO:

- The examples/crew.rb file is pointing towards a hard coded user dir.  Needs to be
documented as part of a working example.
- examples/async_rack_front/async_rack_front.ru needs to be documented and verified working.

Ian:
  - Sync Mapper/Agent#start with nanite-mapper/agent
  - Update docs for Agent#start and Mapper#start
  - Update docs in nanite-agent and nanite-mapper
  - What's the :log option?
  - Ensure file transfer works
  - Ensure admin works
  - Check secure stuff still works
  - Check custom status_proc works
  - Update README
  - Check documentation, only document public methods

Points:

  - Is exchanges.rb old code?
