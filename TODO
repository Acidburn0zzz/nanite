TODO:

- The examples/crew.rb file is pointing towards a hard coded user dir.  Needs to be
documented as part of a working example.
- examples/async_rack_front/async_rack_front.ru needs to be documented and verified working.

Ian:
  - Sync Mapper/Agent#start with nanite-mapper/agent
  - Update docs for Agent#start and Mapper#start
  - Update docs in nanite-agent and nanite-mapper
  - Ensure file transfer works
  - Ensure admin works
  - Check secure stuff still works
  - Check custom status_proc works
  - Check documentation, only document public methods
  - no_declare => true in dispatcher.rb?
  - ensure the removal of threaded_actors option doesn't cause shit to block

  - Add convenience request/push methods to Nanite
  - :no_declare in dispatcher should use config option
  - dump agent identity to config.yml if auto generated
  - Look into using EM deferables for actors dispatch.
  - Integration specs that spawn a small cluster of nanites
  - Check where extlib is used and only include required fields or remove dependency
  - Make mapper queue durable and Results respect :persistent flag on the request
  - Add a global result received callback
  - update README to reflect Nanite.request/push, also updated examples etc...

Points:

  - Is exchanges.rb old code?
  - Removed threaded_actors option as subscribe is async anyway - true?
  - Wouldn't it be better to blow up if the default serializer doesn't work? We could be cascading with every messages and never know.
  - What's the point of || 'index' in the dispatcher?
